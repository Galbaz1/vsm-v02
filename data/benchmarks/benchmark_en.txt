Question 5
================================================================================
Question: Where do you connect the RS-485 bus on the CPU board of the ThorGuard Central Unit, and which terminals are available?
Answer: The RS-485 bus connects to the CPU board at the connector labeled 'RS485'. The terminals are 'D+' (data), 'D-' (data), '0V' (ground), and 'Vdd' (+12 or +24 V nominal).

Question 6
================================================================================
Question: What voltage is typically present on the Vdd/24V line of the RS-485 bus in a 12 V or 24 V system?
Answer: In a 12 V system the nominal voltage is about 14.3 V DC; in a 24 V system it is about 28.3 V DC.

Question 7
================================================================================
Question: How is the RS-485 bus termination resistor in the Central Unit enabled or disabled?
Answer: The termination resistor is enabled or disabled via switch SW3 (or SW4 in some versions) next to the RS-485 connector. ON activates the 220 Ω termination; OFF disables it.
